    <head>History</head>
    <p>Origami by definition is the Japanese art of folding paper into decorative figures and shapes. The word "origami" came from two smaller words in Japannese. Ori, which means to fold, and Kami, which means paper. There are three main kinds of origami. First, single sheet origami, which is when a single sheet of paper is mande into a module. Second, modular origami, which is when multiples of identical modules are pieced together. Third, composite origami, which is a mode that is made of two or more different modules, each folded in different ways. 
        Originally origami was a skill for high-ranking soldier in Japan. Styles of formal gift wrappings were later developed for money, poetry and fans. Over ther years origami has become increasingly complictated. It is now expanded and is used in furniture design, home decor, roboticss design, engineering, and architechture. Origami originally became more widespread because of the expense of paper. Orignially paper was very expensive so origami was limited to the more privileged classes, and was used in religious rituals and formal ceremonies. It was only during the Edo period (1603-1868) that origami became more widepread in Japanese society. This was due to the reduced price of washi paper. It started to rise to the culture practice of formal gift wrappers, envelopes/paper purses, and letter folds for a large population of Japanese society. This populerization was startted when Japanese schools started teaching origami in their art classes.
